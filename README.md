An AI-powered web application that analyzes eye images for common conditions like cataracts, conjunctivitis, and pterygium using advanced Vision Language Models (VLM).

## 🌟 Features

- **Real-time Analysis**: Upload and analyze eye images instantly
- **Multiple Condition Detection**: 
  - Cataracts (clouding, blurry vision)
  - Conjunctivitis (inflammation, redness)
  - Pterygium (tissue growth)
- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Ask specific questions about the uploaded images
- **Educational Information**: Detailed information about each condition
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive Streamlit-based UI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
